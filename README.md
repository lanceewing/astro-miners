# Astro Miners
This is an an entry for js13kGames 2018. The theme for this year is "Offline", and in this case your off-world "Astro Miner" fleet are mysteriously all offline!

The year is 2349 AD, where a private company, Astro Miner Co. (AMC) has begun mining operations on the surface of a large asteriod in our solar system. You work for AMC and are responsible for remotely controlling the 10 robotic miner ships that are deployed to the asteroid.

One day when you arrive at work, you learn that all but one of the ten Astro Miners have been taken offline for some mysterious reason. All you have now at your disposal is the one remaining Miner ship.

It isn't long before you discover that the mining operations have awoken some kind of mindless alien parasite that has been dormant within the minerals of the asteroid for millions of years, and that these parasites have been attacking the Miner ships and taking them offline.

Your mission is to locate the other nine Astro Miners and bring them back online, and to eliminate the alien menace.
